# Assignment For Glossika

## Overview

This is a personal project that showcases a simple media application built using UIKit. The app is structured with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and utilizes Combine for reactive programming. It features a nested `UITableView` containing `UICollectionView` cells that can display both JPG images and videos.

## Features

- **API Mocking**: The application uses Postman to mock the API, allowing for seamless development and testing without a backend.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The project is organized using the MVVM pattern, which separates concerns and promotes a clean code structure.
- **Reactive Programming**: Implemented using Combine, enabling responsive updates to the UI based on data changes.
- **Dynamic Media Display**: Each `UICollectionView` cell supports displaying either JPG images or videos, providing a rich media experience.

## Technologies Used

- **UIKit**: For building the user interface programmatically.
- **Combine**: For handling asynchronous data flows and binding data to the UI.
- **Postman**: For mocking API requests and responses during development.
